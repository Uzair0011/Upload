// *Question 52:* Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details.
// Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen,
//  and how long its battery lasts.

// *Explain & TIP:* Just like a box can contain smaller boxes, objects can contain other objects. This helps organize related information neatly.
